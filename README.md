# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this challenge was to help collect and present data for Plan my Trip which is a travel technology company. The data i collected will help aid customers when they try to filter their travel plans in order to find a hotel anywhere globally. First we need to use the citipy module to get the cities based on latitudes and longitudes and then use the OpenWeatherMap API to perform requests. To conclude we will export the data, clean it, and use Jupyter-Gmaps and the GooglePlaces API in order to map out and display the best routes along with best options for travel.


Step 1: Collect the Data

Step 2: Exploratory Analysis with Visualization

Step 3: Visualize Travel Data
